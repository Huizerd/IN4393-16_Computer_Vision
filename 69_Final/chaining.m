function point_view_matrix = chaining(matches)
% CHAINING Constructs the point-view matrix with the matches found between
%   consecutive frames. This matrix has tracked points as columns, and
%   views/frames as rows and contains the indices of the descriptor for
%   each frame. So, if a certain descriptor can be seen in all frames, its
%   column is completely filled. Similarly, if it can be matched only
%   between frame 1 and 2, only the first 2 rows of its column will be
%   non-zero.
%
% Inputs:
% - matches: cell array containing matches, with descriptor indices for the
%   1st image in the 1st row, indices for the 2nd image in the 2nd row.
%   Each cell contains one frame pair (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, ... , 19-1).
%
% Outputs:
% - point_view_matrix: matrix containing matches between consecutive frames
